\section{Geometrodynamics}\label{sec:chapter1}


\subsection{The parable of the apple}\label{susec:1_1}
Space tells matter how to move and matter tells space how to curve.

\subsection{Spacetime with and without coordinates}\label{susec:1_2}
\subsubsection{\hint for possible different characterization \page{6}}

\enquote{But with all the daring in the world, how is one to drive a nail into spacetime to mark a point? Happily, nature provides its own way to localize a point in spacetime, as Einstein was the first to emphasize. Characterize the point by what happens there!}

\subsubsection{\hint from idealized limit \page{10}}

\enquote{A more detailed diagram would show a maze of world line and of light rays and the intersections between them. From such a picture, one can in imagination step to the \emph{idealized} limit: an infinitely dense collection of light rays and of world lines of infinitesimal test particles.}

\subsubsection{\hint of breakdown of manifold description \page{12}}
\enquote{Not so quantum general relativity or \enquote{quantum geometrodynamics}. It predicts violent fluctuations in the geometry at distances on the order of the Planck length,\dots As nearly as one can estimate these fluctuations give space at small distances a \enquote{multiply connected} or \enquote{foam-like} character.}

	\caption{Forces mentioned in \cbox{1.2},  \emph{Lorand von Eötvös}, where $R$ is the radius of the earth and $\theta$ is the angle measured from the north pole}
	\label{fig:1_3_1}
\end{figure}

The forces mentioned are shown in \reffig{1_3_1}, from which we directly observe that the centripetal acceleration is in total
\[a_z=\omega^2 R \sin(\theta),\]
which is \emph{independent} of $g$ in this way of viewing forces ($\omega$ is the rotation speed of the earth).
From this we get the northward directed part of $a_z$  to be 

\[a_z \cos(\theta)=\omega^2 R \sin(\theta)\cos(\theta).\]

\paragraph{Beall}
We know the highest observed energies of the myon to be \[E_\mu = \SI{1e13}{\electronvolt}.\]
While the upper threshold is mentioned to be \[E_{\text{thresh}}=\num{1e3} m c^2\].
If now the myon were to be \enquote{too light} we would have \[E_\mu>E_{\text{thresh}}.\]

On the other hand we know the highest observed energies of photons to be \[E_\gamma=\SI{1e13}{\electronvolt}.\]
The transferred energy (to a photon) mentioned results in \[E_\gamma\geq 2 m c^2.\] These two observations combined put an upper limit (Not \enquote{too heavy}) on $m$.

\subsubsection{\enquote{This assumption of exact physical equivalence makes it impossible for us to speak of the absolute acceleration of the system of reference, \dots} \page{17}}
This because any part of the acceleration could be due to a gravitational field.
